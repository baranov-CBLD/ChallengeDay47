# Test Day 47
Hello! This is a completed day 47 challenge project (100 days of SwiftUI).

## Implementation of some important functions for data saving and navigation.

1. Saving activity data in UserDefaults using @Observable macro.
2. Using .navigationDestination to create a specific activity view only when the user wants to open and interact with it.
3. Using NavigationPath to open an activity view right after creating it, so the user can continue working with it.
4. Storing the app's last location using path storage, so it opens in the same place where the user left off.
